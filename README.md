# Cryptocurrency Price Tracking System

## Project Overview

This ongoing project by Jesus Naranjo and Kelly Tsidji focuses on creating a cryptocurrency price tracking system with data collection and visualization capabilities.

### Phase One:

In the first phase, two primary scripts have been developed: `crypto_data_collector.py` and `crypto_price_visualizer.py`. These scripts work together to gather real-time cryptocurrency data and visualize it using Matplotlib.

#### Contributors

- Jesus Naranjo
- Kelly Tsidji

#### Scripts

##### `crypto_data_collector.py`

The `crypto_data_collector.py` script serves as the data collection component of the project. It interacts with the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and provides options for displaying and saving the collected data.

##### `crypto_price_visualizer.py`

The `crypto_price_visualizer.py` script is responsible for visualizing real-time cryptocurrency prices in a dynamic and interactive manner. It utilizes Matplotlib's animation capabilities to create live plots of price movements.

#### Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

- `requests`: Used for making API requests to the CoinGecko API.
- `matplotlib`: Utilized for creating visualizations and live plots.
- Other potential dependencies based on the project's specific requirements.

To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
