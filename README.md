This is a ongoing project by Jesus Naranjo and Kelly Tsidji

**Phase one:**

<kbd>    This is an indented paragraph.</kbd>

This phase of the project aims to create a cryptocurrency price tracking system with data collection and visualization capabilities.      In the first phase, two primary scripts have been developed: crypto_data_collector.py and crypto_price_visualizer.py. These scripts 
work in tandem to gather real-time cryptocurrency data and visualize it using Matplotlib.

    crypto_data_collector.py:
        The crypto_data_collector.py script serves as the data collection component of the project. It interacts with the CoinGecko API           to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and provides options for displaying and saving the collected data.

    crypto_price_visualizer.py:
        The crypto_price_visualizer.py script is responsible for visualizing real-time cryptocurrency prices in a dynamic and interactive         manner. It uses Matplotlib's animation capabilities to create live plots of price movements.
